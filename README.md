# 🌸 Khushiee's DSA Garden

Welcome to my personal collection of Data Structures — a growing set of beautifully organized, easy-to-understand code snippets and concepts that help me learn, grow, and prepare for coding interviews & problem-solving.

## 🧩 What's Inside?

- 🔹 Arrays & Strings  
- 🔹 Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- 🔹 Stacks & Queues  
- 🔹 Trees & Binary Trees  
- 🔹 Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's etc.)  
- 🔹 Heaps, HashMaps, and more!  
- 🔹 Dynamic Programming ✨  
- 🔹 Interview-based Patterns

## 💻 Languages Used:
- Python 🐍  
- C++ 💻  
(*Planning to add Java in future too! 🌱*)

## 🌱 Why I Built This?
I wanted a place where:
- I could revise with clarity
- Keep all my code ✨clean & well-commented✨
- And maybe help someone else who's also learning 💛
